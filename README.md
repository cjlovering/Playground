#playground

A platform for my visual displays, allowing me to showcase my different
experiments, but also maintain performance. Furthermore, the platform is
set up to be easily maintainable and support future growth.

## live!
playground.vision

## current active displays
* Stars
* Hubs
* HexLife
* Gradients

## future
* Clicking on a script will enlarge it to the full screen.
* Two more visualizations are en route!
* A control box that can modify parameters of all scripts
* Smoother transitions
* Pause/play/stop states for all visualizations
* Higher performance by only running one of the scripts fully at any given time

## deployment
I am currently using browserify to compile the app into a single file. If you want to run it locally, enter these commands:

```git
git clone https://github.com/cjlovering/Playground.git
```
```node
npm install
```
```node
npm run build
```

Open the app in your localhost!
