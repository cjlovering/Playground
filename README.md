#playground

A platform for my visual displays, showcasing multiple experiments,
while maintaining performance. The platform is set up to be easily
maintainable and support future growth. All displays can be full screened
by double clicking on them, or by clicking the expand button. Settings
can be modified by pulling the menu over from the left in the full screen
view or by clicking on the gear icon.

## current active displays
* Stars
* Hubs
* HexLife
* Gradients

## deployment
I am currently using browserify to compile the app into a single file. If you want to run it locally, enter these commands:

```git
git clone https://github.com/cjlovering/Playground.git
```
```node
npm install
```
```node
npm run build
```

Open the app in your localhost! (If you don't have that set up, you can just click on
the index.html in your GUI file navigator.)
